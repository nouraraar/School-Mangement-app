=> If you want to use a local database for a better UX , you can use XAMPP or workbench to import it - we used both of them because some of us are more familiare with phpMyAdmin and others with MySQL workbench. ,The database will be in database/administration_DB.sql

=> If you want to use the online database , the user infromations will be in OnlineDB_user.txt

The project folder contains all of the project in the development environement (source codes). The database folder contains the database file.

The tutorial folder contains videos that shows you briefly the correct way to run our applications and few general errors that might occurie.

Note : Please note that we are using a free remote Database service which gives as limited bandwith / storage and period. If the database stopped working then the database has exceeded the period (LIMIT = 02 July 2020) provided by remotemysql.com , you can always connect your server to the local database .
